### Key Features

#### Data Extraction
Extractor can extract the following data:

- URLs
- URLs with parameters (`example.com/gallery.php?id=2`)
- Intel (emails, social media accounts, amazon buckets etc.)
- Files (pdf, png, xml etc.)
- Secret keys (auth/API keys & hashes)
- JavaScript files & Endpoints present in them
- Strings matching custom regex pattern
- Subdomains & DNS related data

A tool which is written in Bash Shell Scripting is capable of extracting Email, IP, Phone Number [INDIAN] and URL from a file using Regular Expressions. :)
